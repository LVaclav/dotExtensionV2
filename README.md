# DOTExtension
Automatic DOT Test Booker:
This extension runs on the West Australian Department of Transport Practical Driving Assessment booking site. It will automatically find and book the test you want. 
## Desciprtion
The plugin injects custom HTML and JavaScript into the site. It adds an auto-booking menu with a range of options. Users can define date parameters, location preferences and time preferences. 
The plugin can toggle between "Alert" or "Book" Mode. "Alert" mode will simply pause and alert the user of an available test. The "booking" mode will book the first test available that meets the user parameters. 

**NOTE:** I have dropped support of this plugin as I have a license and the DOT has implemented anti-scraping measures and a refresh limit. It still works, just set a reasonablke refresh time in the User Params. Good Luck.
